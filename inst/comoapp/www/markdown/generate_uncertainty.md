If you decide to perform several model runs, **we recommend to go for a minimum of 10 runs.**


### Running time

When performimng several model runs, simulation time can amount to 1 second per run and half a minute to aggregate results.


### Noise

You can decide on the amount of noise to add to a selection of parameters at each run. When not confident on a results, have a higher noise. When the noise is higher...

The following parameters have some noise adedd: "p", "rho", "omega", "gamma", "nui", "ihr_scaling", "nus", "nusc", "nu_icu", "nu_icuc", "nu_vent", "nu_ventc", "rhos", "selfis_eff", "dist_eff", "hand_eff", "work_eff", "w2h", "school_eff", "s2h", "cocoon_eff", "mean_imports", "screen_overdispersion", "quarantine_effort", "quarantine_eff_home", "quarantine_eff_other".

Provide formula explaining how the noise is added.
